# Mini Data Analyses üìù

This repository contains a collection of small, self-contained data analyses (e.g., in `.ipynb` notebooks or `.py` scripts).  
Each analysis is stored in a separate folder or file, along with a short description and a link to the dataset used.

## How to use this repository?

- Each analysis is located in its own folder or file (e.g., `analysis_01`, `analysis_02`).
- Inside each folder, you‚Äôll find the analysis notebook (`.ipynb`) or script (`.py`) and a `README.md` file describing the analysis and linking to the data source.
- The full list of analyses is provided below.

## How to add your own analysis?

1. Create a new folder named after your analysis (e.g., `analysis_03`).
2. Add your notebook (e.g., `my_analysis.ipynb`) or script.
3. Add a short `README.md` in that folder describing your analysis and linking to the dataset.
4. Add an entry to the main table above!
